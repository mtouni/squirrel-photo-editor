# squirrel-photo-editor
Photo editor app for android

This is an app that allows the user to import photos from the gallery of their phone/camera and edit them using the filters provided in the app. There is a save functionality which lets the user save the edited apps into their sdcard. A folder 'sqrl-edtr-saved' is generated and the results are saved in this folder.
